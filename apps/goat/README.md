# GOAT proof builder app worker

The GOAT proof builder (`proof-builder-rpc`) runs as a Fleet integrated app worker. It does
three things on one machine-pinned replica:

- It serves the Bitcoin node proof API (`/v1/proofs/*`, signed requests).
- It proves the header, commit and state chains continuously, and operator and watchtower
  proofs on demand.
- It proves directly against the replica's loopback Ziren GPU server.

Its task database and proofs stay in the app's storage root. Fleet manages lifecycle,
resources and exclusive use of the GPU server; it does not interpret the worker's state. The
worker's own behaviour is documented in `proof-builder-rpc/README.md` ("Fleet app worker mode")
in the source tree.

Fleet pins the worker in the `third_party/bitvm-node` Git submodule. It tracks
`feat/fetch-state-chain` of the `blake-pro/bitvm-node` fork and is pinned at
`c128be280ef45cfea135f745c0c8b467e56c9ccb`. Once the branch lands in
`GOATNetwork/bitvm-node`:

1. Switch the submodule URL to `GOATNetwork/bitvm-node`.
2. Re-pin it to the merged commit.

Initialize it with `git submodule update --init third_party/bitvm-node`. Deployment and
packaging use the committed pin; never use `git submodule update --remote`. Host and guests
use Ziren `a4d47079b45eecb244adc27ffa3daaac57de523b`.

## App identity

Each package is a Fleet proof app: a namespace app with its own name, for example
`goat-proof-builder-v1`, whose `elf_id` is the package's bundle id. The bundle id covers all
five guest programs:

1. List each program as `<name> <ELF SHA-256>`, sorted by name: commit-chain, header-chain,
   operator, state-chain, watchtower.
2. Take the SHA-256 of those lines.

`proof-builder-rpc --print-programs` prints the ELF digests, program IDs, verifying-key
hashes, wrap mode and bundle id; the package stores this output as `programs.json`.

At startup the worker checks that its embedded programs, `programs.json`, `ZKM_IMM_WRAP_VK`
and Fleet's app id all agree. After each program's GPU setup it also checks the verifying
key.

`BITCOIN_NETWORK` is compiled into the host and the guests, so each network has its own
bundle id. Any guest change produces a new app identity. For a new identity:

- register a new app name, and use a new service name and storage root;
- follow the cutover below;
- keep the previous package until the new one has been verified.

A worker-only change keeps the identity and storage root.

For the existing `goat-proof-builder-v2` on `ant-5090-2`, follow the
[testnet4 deployment and header initialization procedure](header-chain-bootstrap.md).
It uses the current `prefer_local_headers_on_init` option to prove the first 157000 headers
in one batch, then continues with one header per batch. Existing database progress takes
precedence over the TOML; the procedure backs it up before resetting only header-chain rows.
The earlier `[header_chain_bootstrap]` patch and `--check-storage` command are not part of
the current pinned source.

Fleet reserves the GPU server for exactly the app named by the service's `app` and `elf_id`.
No SDK submission reaches that app, because the bundle id is not the digest of any ELF.
Fleet does not know which ELFs the bundle contains, so it still accepts SDK submissions to
separate per-program apps registered with a member ELF's `elf_id`. While the bundle worker is
enabled, operators must therefore ensure:

- every per-program GOAT SDK app is disabled;
- the previous proof builder is stopped;
- no other GOAT bundle is enabled.

Check with `fleetctl --namespace NAMESPACE --json app` before and after every change.

## Build

The package must contain the guests that are deployed on chain. Every build compares its
`programs.json` against a committed baseline and fails on any difference:

```bash
apps/goat/build.sh testnet4 apps/goat/baseline/testnet4.json /tmp/goat-package
```

Building `proof-builder-rpc` compiles the five guest circuits from the submodule source with
the Ziren MIPS toolchain (`~/.zkm-toolchain/env` is sourced when present). `--elf-dir` reads
validated `<program>.elf` files for the five programs instead, embeds them and skips guest
compilation. Prefer it on a machine whose source build may not reproduce the baseline's ELFs.
Only the shared `circuits` guest workspace with unique `<program>-guest` binary targets is
supported. Sync the pinned submodule before building. The script resolves its target directory
through Cargo metadata; by default the ELFs are under
`third_party/bitvm-node/circuits/target/elf-compilation/mipsel-zkm-zkvm-elf/release/`.
Packaging verifies the ELF paths reported by this build's `ZKM_ELF_<program>-guest` directives,
recorded in `build-messages.jsonl` and `guest-elf-paths.json` in the output directory.

When the guests change, create the baseline from the same build with `--new-baseline`. The
baseline must not exist yet:

```bash
apps/goat/build.sh testnet4 apps/goat/baseline/testnet4.json /tmp/goat-package --new-baseline
```

It writes `testnet4.json`, in the format of [`baseline.example.json`](baseline.example.json),
and `testnet4.operator-vk-hash`, the operator VK hash the contracts must hold, and packages the
build. The header, state, commit and watchtower program IDs authorized on chain
(`sequencer-set-publish --program-id-manifest`) must equal the baseline's `program_id` values.
Review both files and commit them under `baseline/`.

The script:

- requires committed submodule source and a clean tree;
- sets `BITCOIN_NETWORK`, and `ZKM_IMM_WRAP_VK=1` (the deployed wrap mode);
- builds `proof-builder-rpc` with `--locked`;
- checks each embedded ELF digest and the bundle id;
- writes `proof-builder-rpc`, `programs.json`, `fleet-app-id`, `source-revision` and
  `SHA256SUMS`.

## Install and configure

1. Install the package at `/opt/zkm-fleet/apps/goat`.
2. Pre-install the Groth16 circuit artifacts for the Fleet execution user. The Groth16 wrap
   and the local verification run on the worker's CPU. With `ZKM_IMM_WRAP_VK=1` the SDK reads
   them from `~/.zkm/circuits/groth16/imm-wrap-vk/v2.0.0`. Copy them from the current proof
   builder host, which already uses them, and do not rely on a download during proving.
3. Create the storage root:

   ```text
   /srv/zkm-fleet/apps/goat/            proof_storage_root (FLEET_APP_STORAGE_ROOT)
     proof-builder.lock                 exclusive worker lock
     run/                               worker_workdir: proof-builder.toml, the sqlite
                                        database and *.ckpt files
     circuits/data/{header-chain,commit-chain,state-chain,operator,watchtower}/
   ```

   The working directory is `run/`. Relative `../circuits/data/...` paths in the database,
   the config and state-chain snapshots therefore resolve inside the root. The worker
   refuses to start when its working directory or database is outside the root.
4. Adapt [`services.example.yaml`](services.example.yaml) to the node's `services.yaml`. Fill
   in the namespace, the app name, `elf_id`, the machine and the resources. `elf_id` is the
   content of the package's `fleet-app-id`; YAML does not expand `$(cat ...)`. Size `cpus` for the
   Groth16 wrap as well as the GPUs. Keep `--drain-timeout-secs` below
   `worker_stop_timeout_s`, and set both from the longest proof measured in staging.
5. Put credentials and RPC endpoints in the private file described by
   [`worker.env.example`](worker.env.example), readable only by the worker account. Fleet
   supplies the GPU endpoint, storage root, app name (`FLEET_APP`), namespace, `elf_id` and
   parent-exit behavior. Do not set `ZKM_PROVER`, `ENDPOINT` or `FLEET_TOKEN_FILE`.

   Also set `FLEET_APP_TENANT=goat` in this file. The pinned worker still requires
   `FLEET_APP_TENANT`, but Fleet no longer injects it: apps are named without tenants, and
   Fleet supplies `FLEET_APP` instead. The worker only uses the value to label its log, and
   Fleet does not override it. Without it the worker exits at startup with
   `FLEET_APP_TENANT is required when Fleet launches the proof builder`. Drop the line once
   the pinned worker reads `FLEET_APP`.
6. Expose the API through an authenticated HTTPS proxy on the machine. The worker binds
   `127.0.0.1:7777` and serves metrics on `127.0.0.1:9109`. Either repoint the existing proof
   builder hostname, or update `PROOF_SERVER_URL` on the Operator and Challenger nodes.

The example follows the selected `ghcr.io/projectzkm/ziren-gpu:latest` image. Pull it on the
GPU node before restarting this app and record its resolved digest for recovery. The tag
can move; this configuration does not establish compatibility with the current `3cf393cd`
SDK pin. Verify Groth16 proofs against the deployed host and guests before resuming all
tasks. In Fleet mode the service's `image` field selects the GPU image; SDK Docker image
environment variables do not select this external server.

## Cutover

Stop the old path before starting the new one, so the GPUs and quota are free and no proof
runs twice.

1. Build the package and confirm it against the baseline. Install it and the Groth16
   artifacts. Register the bundle under a new app name:

   ```bash
   fleetctl --namespace NAMESPACE app add goat-proof-builder-v1 \
     --elf-id "$(cat /opt/zkm-fleet/apps/goat/fleet-app-id)"
   ```

   Use `--elf-id`, not `--elf`: the bundle id is not the digest of a single ELF. Then add the
   service to `services.yaml` disabled, with `app` set to that name and `elf_id` to the
   bundle id, and wait for the node heartbeat to advertise it.

2. Stop every submission source: stop the old proof builder, and archive its database
   read-only.
3. Disable and drain each per-program SDK app, then confirm that its GPU container is gone
   and its resources are released. `fleetctl --namespace NAMESPACE --json app` shows each
   app's `proof.elf_id`; match them against `programs.json`:

   ```bash
   fleetctl --namespace NAMESPACE app disable SDK_APP_NAME
   ```

4. Copy the database, `circuits/data/**` (including state-chain `.args`/`.ctx` snapshots)
   and `proof-builder.toml` into the storage root. Every proven proof needs the sidecars its
   readers use: `.public_inputs.bin`, `.vk_hash.bin` and `.zkm_version.bin`, plus `.blocks`
   for header-chain and `.commits` for commit-chain proofs.
5. Enable and scale the app:

   ```bash
   fleetctl --namespace NAMESPACE app enable goat-proof-builder-v1
   ```

   Watch `<log_dir>/goat-proof-builder-v1-0.node.log` until the first proof has been committed.
6. Switch the proxy or `PROOF_SERVER_URL`. Confirm that nodes receive operator and watchtower
   proofs.
7. To roll back: disable the bundle app and confirm its GPUs are released. Then
   restore the SDK apps and the old proof builder, in reverse order, from the cutover
   snapshot.

## Operate and recover

The database and the published proof files are the worker's whole state; restarts resume
from them.

- **Atomic publication.** A proof and its sidecars are published through synced temporary
  files. A `<proof>.manifest.json`, written last, marks the set complete. The database
  records a proof only after publication, so nodes never read partial files.
- **Interrupted proofs.** If the process stops after publishing but before the database
  commit, the proof is redone on restart and atomically replaces the files.
- **Shared GPU.** The GPU server runs one proof at a time in FIFO order. An operator or
  watchtower task waits at most for one proof of each other task.
- **Timeouts win.** An operator or watchtower task stays `New` while it queues and proves.
  Its result is written only while it is still `New`, so a timeout from the node wins.
- **Failures:**
  - A GPU server that stops reporting ready, or a proof that cannot be published, leaves
    the task pending. The worker exits and Fleet restarts the replica with a new GPU server.
  - A failed GPU call whose guest still executes on the CPU is a prover or transport fault.
    The proof is retried in place, and the failure does not count.
  - A guest that rejects its input, or a proof that does not verify, marks the task `Failed`
    after `--max-proof-attempts` consecutive failures (default 2).
- **Shutdown.** SIGTERM stops new proofs. The proof in progress may finish publishing and
  committing within `--drain-timeout-secs`; after that the process exits regardless. Exit
  codes: 0 after a clean stop, 1 after a task failure or an abandoned proof, 101 after a
  panic.
- **Disabling the app.** `fleetctl app disable` stops the actor directly; any unfinished
  proof is redone after the app is enabled again.

Inspect progress through the worker log and its metrics. Each proof attempt is counted with
an outcome: `success`, `failed`, `transient`, `unavailable` or `cancelled`.

For staging recovery tests, build with the `fault-injection` feature (outside `build.sh`). Setting
`PROOF_BUILDER_FAULT=after-publish` then exits right after a proof is published and before
its database commit.

For node capacity and installed Fleet changes, follow the
[maintenance procedure](../../docs/maintenance.md).
